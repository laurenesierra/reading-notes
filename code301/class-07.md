## REST Explained:

[How I Explained REST to My Brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. 
URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

Machines use URLs to tell other machines about a resource that might be on yet another machine.
