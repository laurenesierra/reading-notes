# Node.js

_Node.js_ is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform.


_Heroku_ is a cloud platform as a service.  It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer.

There is an acronym created to describe such type of applications Node.js was created for. It's __DIRT__. It means _Data-Intensive Real-Time applications_. Node allows a server to handle a lot of connections and work with a number of requests at the same time. And you don't need much memory for that. It's designed to be responsive and fast. Just like your web browser! So, it's useful when you need to create an application that will be able to respond instantly to a large number of users. And Node was built from scratch to provide you with such a functionality.
