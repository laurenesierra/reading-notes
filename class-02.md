# HTML

As well as providing structure to your web page, HTML provides semantic information.

- eg. where emphasis should be placed
- eg. the definition of any acronymns used when given text is a quotation


__Remember__ : it helps to view things as being in a container (box).

# CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that apply to the things inside your container.

A CSS rule contains two parts:

1. a selector
1. a declaration

```
p (selector) {
    font-family: Ariel;}
    (declaration)
```

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts:

1. a property
1. a value

```
p {
    font-family: (property) Arial (value)
    
}
```

### CSS Selectors:

Selectors allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document,
- Universal selectors
- Type selector
- Class selector
- ID selector
- Child selector
- Descendant selector
- Adjacent sibling selector
- General sibling selector


### Javascript

A _script_ is a series of statements or instructions for the browser.

A script temporarily stores information it needs to do it's job. It stores this info in _variables_.


An _array_ is a special type of variable. It stores a list of values as opposed to just one value.

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. __It is important to know that the numbering start at zero not one__.


The blowser runs different code in different situations. You can keep track of this using flowcharts.


### Comparison Operators:

At the most basic level you can evaluate two variables using _comparison operators_. This will return either "true" or "false" (eg. Boolean Value).

### Logical Operators:

_Logical operators_ allow you to compare the results of more then one comparison operator.

### If Statements:

The _if statement_ checks a condition. if that statement is true the statements in the code block are executed.

### If Else Statements:

_If else statements_ check a condition. 

- If it is true, the code block is exicuted.
- If the statement is false, the second code block is run.

## Git Commit Messages:

__Keep things clear and consise!__

    
A well-cared for log is a beautiful and useful thing.      Reviewing othersâ€™ commits and pull requests becomes something worth doing, and suddenly can be done independently. Understanding why something happened months or years ago becomes not only possible but efficient.


A projects long term success and maintainance is dependeant upon having clear, effient logs.
