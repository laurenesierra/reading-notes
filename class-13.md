# The Past, Present and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications

Persistent local storage is one of the areas where native client applications have held an addvantage over web applications.  For native applications, the operating system typically provides an abstaction layer for storing and retrieving application specific data like preferences or runtime state.  These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place according to platform convention. If your native client application needs local storage beyond key/value pairs, you can embed your own database, invent your own file format, or any number of other solutions.
