# Tables

A table represents data in a grid format.  Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information of two axes. Each block on the grid is referred to as a _cell table_.

```
<table>
  <tr>
  <th scope="row">List Heading</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

The _table_ element is used to added tables to web pages.
A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the _tr_ element. Inside each row are a number of cells represented by the _td_ element or _th_ if it's a header.

For long tables you can split the table into:
```
<thead>
<tbody>
<tfooter>
```
