## What is a growth mindset?

Having the confidence to explore, knowing that mistakes are an opportunity for growth. Inteligence or talent is just a starting point.

## How can we create a growth minset?
- Face Challenges: 
Challenges can be exciting and engaging! Worst case scenerio you end up in "the pit" and learn something. 
- Pay attention to your words and thoughts:
Listen to the words your are speaking (especially in your head!) and stick to postitivity. Don't let negative judgemental thought cloud your ability to succeed.
- Remember that no one is good in the begining: It takes time, mistakes and support to succeed.

__Dont forget!__ This is a continual work in progress. We are all learning and growing daily.
