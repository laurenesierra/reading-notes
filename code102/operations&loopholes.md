## Comperisons and Operaters



### Comprison operators:

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to see what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: True or False.


### Logical Operators:
These allow you to compare the results of more then one comparison opperator.

### Loops

These check a condition. If it returns "true" then the code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns "true" the code will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.
