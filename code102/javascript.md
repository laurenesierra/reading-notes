# Javascript

#### Chapter 1/C

1. It is best to keep Javascript code in it's own file.

1. The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the Javascript file.
1. If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JS will not have changed the HTML. This is because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
 
### __Statements:__ 

Computers operate different then we do. Keep in mind that your instructions need to reflect how computers get things done.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can followone by one. Each individual instruction or step is called a _statement_. Statements are green.

Each statement should start on a new line and end in a semicolon. This makes the code easier to read and follow.

### __Code Blocks:__

Some statements are surrounded by pink curly braces. These are called _code blocks_. Code blocks make it easier to read and organize code.
 
 The code that is purple shows which code should run.

 ### __Comments:__

 - Multi line comments
 /* */
 These are often used to describe how the code works, or to prevent code from running during testing.

 - Single line comments
 //
 These are often short descriptions of what the code is doing.


 ### __Variables__

 1. Declare (announce that you want to use it)
 1. Assign value tell it the info you would like it to store

 ### __Data Types__

 1. Numeric data (This handles numbers)
 1. String data (Ths handles letters and other characters)

 1. Boolean (This can only have one of two values, Either _true_ or _false_.)


### Chapter 1


 
Scripts are like recipes, handbooks or manuels. A set of step by step instructions.

1. Define your goal
1. Design your script
1. Code each step

Vocabulary= The words that computers understand

Syntax= How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

Concantation= Joining together two or more strings to create one new string.
 
Functions= These let you group together a series of statements together to perform a specifiic task.
