### "What Makes a Computer a commputer?"


Computers are tools to help us solve our problems. 

### These things are common to all computers. They:

 - Input
 - Store
 - Process 
 - and Output 

 information.



### Input:

The stuff we do that makes the computer do things. Like a keyboard, touchscreen, microphone, camera etc.

### Storage:

Computers take the input we give them and store them in memory. From there the processor takes the info and processes that info using _algorithms_ (which is a process of commands). It then sends the info back to memory until outout.

### Output:

Like photos videos, games, commands to robots eg.
This depends on what the computer is designed to do.

### Binary and Data:

A single wire with electricity flowing though it has two choices.

On or off.
Yes or no.
True or false.
1 or 0.
or anything else with 2 options.

These pieces of info are called _bits_. It is the smallest amount of info a computer can store.

More wires=more bits=more info

### Binary Number System:

This number system is made up of just two digits, 0 and 1.

  With these you can represent any number you want. 

  More bits means a higher range of numbers. This gets you better quality output.

  ### Circits and Logic:

  Circits are a series of wires in your computer. They take input and combine this inormation.

  The more circits the more combining (or adding).

  ### CPU, Memory, Input and Output:

CPU= Central Processing Unit

Input :

- When type something (like a letter) a comp turns that letter into a series of numbers.
- From here the CPU determines how to display in pixels. 
 - The CPU uses step by step info from memory on how to draw the letter.
 - The CPU runs and  then sends the image back to memory for storage.
 - Lasty this info is sent to the screen.

 All of this info is processed in less then a split second.



Output devices can be:

- Speakers
- Printers
- and more

They can also control physical motion like a machine or car engine.

### Hardware and Software:

(This lady brings her dog with her to work every day!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Hardware: Speakers, circits, chips, wires etc

Software: Computer programs like maps, games, apps, web pages and data science.


How do they interact?

The CPU is a master chip that controls the other parts of the computer. It knows which circit to use and when to use them.


Sotware tells the CPU waht to do. 

Operating system= The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer (like windows OS).

- It controls other parts of the computer. 
- It lets you install new programs by loading them into the memory. 
- It also decides when a program is run and whether the program can access the input and output devices of the computer.
- When the comp is running multiple programs at a time, your CPU is quickly switching between programs sharing the CPU.


Every computer has an operating system controls the software that controls the computers hardware.  The software is made up of a series of binary commands. Thes commands are just a series of electrical currents that flow through wires.

Computers have the potential to do all kinds of amazing things but the only thing the makes computers smart or helpful is __you__! 

When you write code you are defining the problems you want to solve and write the software that turns your ideas into reality.

### The internet-IP addressess and DNS:

The internet is a network of networks.


"One thing that most people do not appreciate is that the internet is really a design philosiphy and an architecture expressed in a series of protocals."
- (Vint Cerf, co-creater of the internet)

ISP="Internet Service Provider"
