# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

 _Big O_ notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. _Big O_ specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

 Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.  

 - If the values match, it will return success. 

 - If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element, it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it.

 - Likewise, if the target value is lower than the value of the probe element, it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can no longer split the data set.
