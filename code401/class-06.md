# How to use the Random Module in Python

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

### Randint:

If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

### Random:

If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

### Choice:

Generate a random value from the sequence sequence. The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.

### Shuffle:

The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

### Randrange:

Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

### Possible risks that you could encounter:

- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application
