# Color Schemes


## Neutral Colors

Neutral colors are gentle, calming, and subtle. They differ to monochrome colors—black and white—in that they lack contrast and visual impact. Although earth colors are also inspired by hues found in nature, neutrals are different in that they tend to be softer on the eye, unlike earth colors which can be fiery and vivid.

## Black and White

The combination of black and white offers the maximum contrast possible because they come from opposite ends of the color spectrum. Black and white websites are classical, strong and powerful, but most of all this color combination is the epitome of elegance. Black and white is a timeless combination, it always works and never goes out of fashion.
