### Structure

_Tags_ are like containers. They tell you information about what's inside of them.  _Atrributes_ provide additional defining characteristics about what's inside.

### Extra Markup

`<!---->`

### The ABC's of Javascript

A script is a step-by-step series of instructions for your computer. Just like a recipe or manual.

To write a script, 1st: state your goal. 2nd: come up with a list of tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve your goal.

__You need to provide the computer enough detail to perfom the task, as if every time is the first time.__

It pays to spend time planning and designing before starting to write code.

When you want to use Javascript in your web page, you can use the `<script></script>` element to tell the browser it is coming across script. It's src attribute tells people where the Javascript file is stored. When the browser comes across a `<script>` element it stops to load the script and checks to see if it needs to do anything.

Javascript files are text flies. They are just like HTML pages and CSS style sheets except they have a __.js__ extension.
